# 📊 Walmart Weekly Sales Analysis (2010–2012)

This project analyzes Walmart's weekly sales performance between 2010 and 2012. It focuses on identifying seasonal trends, evaluating the impact of holidays, and examining the influence of external variables such as temperature and unemployment on sales.

## 📈 1. Weekly Sales Trends

* Weekly sales remain relatively stable around $1.0M–$1.1M across all stores.

* Major spikes occur every late November to December, likely due to Thanksgiving and Christmas.

* The week before Christmas in 2010 reached a peak of ~$81M, a 71% increase from the average.



## 🎉 2. Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales

* Holiday weeks average $1.1M, compared to $1.0M for non-holiday weeks.

* T-test confirms the difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0076).

* However, only key holidays (e.g., Christmas, Thanksgiving) create meaningful spikes.





## 🌡️ 3. Influence of External Factors

### 🧊 Temperature

* No clear linear relationship between temperature and weekly holiday sales.



### 💼 Unemployment

* Slight downward trend, but weak correlation overall.

* Consumers appear to continue spending during holidays regardless of unemployment levels.



## 📌 4. Business Recommendations

* Focus promotional efforts on Thanksgiving and Christmas, as they drive the most sales.

* Avoid over-investing in less impactful holidays.

* Walmart's sales during holidays appear resilient to weather and macroeconomic stress.

## 💡 5. Key Takeaway

>Holiday sales impact is not evenly distributed. Strategic focus on major events leads to better ROI.

## 🛠️ 6. Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, SciPy)
